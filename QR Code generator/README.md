Basic QR Code generator.
Ability to choose the output file name.
File is saved in user's download folder.
Ability to display the qrcode in a new window after generation.
Displays error messages if text encoded is too long for a qrcode, if the file name contains invalid characters, if a file with the same name already exists to avoid erasing it.
NOTE : I don't recommand trying to generate qrcode from texts over 2300 characters, as the qrcode module doesn't support more than that for some types of characters.
